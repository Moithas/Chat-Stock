POST-RESET PRICE FORMULA CHANGES
========================================

Apply these changes AFTER the master reset when everyone starts fresh at $100.

CURRENT VALUES (keep until reset):
- Activity: +0.5% per message (uncapped)
- Demand: +0.5% per share, max +50%
- Decay: -5% per day after 3 days inactive, max -50%

NEW VALUES (apply after reset):
- Activity: +0.2% per message, CAP at +60%
- Demand: +0.3% per share, max +30%  
- Decay: -3% per day after 3 days inactive, max -30%

WHY THESE CHANGES:
- Slower growth for new users (300 msgs to hit cap vs 100 msgs to double)
- Less volatility when old messages fall off the 15-day window
- Popular stocks won't spiral as quickly
- Gentler penalty for casual users who take days off

HOW TO APPLY:
Just tell the assistant: "Apply the post-reset price formula changes from RESET-NOTES.txt"

The changes are in database.js (calculateStockPrice function) and commands/help.js
